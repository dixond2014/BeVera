This is a preview to R Shiny


We will first create a distribution curve just to see how to create your own Shiny App in R! Then I will need you all to open, in a new tab, the link to [a Shiny/R application to view and annotate copy number variations](https://github.com/gzhmat/ShinyCNV). This application was not created by me but by:
#### Zhaohui Gu, Charles G Mullighan; ShinyCNV: a Shiny/R application to view and annotate DNA copy number variations, Bioinformatics, bty546, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty546
