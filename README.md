We will first create a distribution curve just to see how to create your own Shiny App in R!

This application was not created by me but by:
#### Zhaohui Gu, Charles G Mullighan; ShinyCNV: a Shiny/R application to view and annotate DNA copy number variations, Bioinformatics, bty546, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty546
